   ```

2. In another terminal, run an example:
   ```bash
   cargo run --example zhtp_testnet
   ```

3. Open the browser interface:
   ```
   http://localhost:7000/browser/
   ```

## Browser Integration

All examples integrate with the browser interface:
- Deployed DApps appear in the DApps tab
- DNS records show in the DNS tab  
- Transactions appear in the Blocks tab
- Network health updates in real-time

## Features Demonstrated

- **Zero-Knowledge Consensus**: ZK-SNARK based consensus with economic incentives
- **ZK HTTPS Tunnel**: Decentralized CA and DNS replacement
- **Cross-Chain Bridge**: Multi-blockchain interoperability
- **Economics System**: Complete tokenomics with rewards, fees, and governance
- **Storage Layer**: Distributed content storage with ZK proofs

## System Overview

The ZHTP protocol provides a complete decentralized internet replacement with:

1. **Decentralized Certificate Authority**: ZK-based certificates replacing traditional CA hierarchy
2. **DNS Replacement**: Distributed name resolution with ZK proofs
3. **HTTPS Tunnel**: End-to-end encrypted communications with ZK privacy
4. **Economic Incentives**: Token-based reward system for network participation
5. **Cross-Chain Bridge**: Interoperability between different blockchain networks
6. **Consensus Layer**: ZK-SNARK based consensus for network agreement

## Architecture

```
ZHTP Node
├── ZK Consensus Engine    (Byzantine fault tolerance with ZK proofs)
├── HTTPS Tunnel          (TLS replacement with ZK certificates)
├── Cross-Chain Bridge    (Multi-blockchain interoperability)
├── Economics System      (Tokenomics and incentive mechanisms)
├── Storage Layer         (Distributed content with ZK verification)
└── Discovery Network     (Peer discovery and routing)
```

## Getting Started

1. Run the testnet example to see the full system in action
2. Examine the economics example to understand tokenomics
3. Review the source code in `src/zhtp/` for implementation details
4. Check the test suite for integration examples

The system is designed to be a drop-in replacement for traditional internet infrastructure while providing enhanced privacy, decentralization, and economic incentives.

## 📊 Production Status

All examples demonstrate production-ready components:

✅ **Zero-Knowledge Protocols**: Post-quantum secure
